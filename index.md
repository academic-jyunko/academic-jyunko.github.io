Artificial Intelligence, Music Theories. There's going to be something more academic and something that fascinates me. I have always had an absurd idea-composing music in a programming language and programming in a music language.[~~Maybe we can really try it !~~](https://github.com/retrofor/retro)

## Current

<br/>

I am contributing to the ASR speech detection sensitive word system based on MFSC algorithm.
In the rest of the time, I am committed to the development of a robot whl that connects QQ, WeChat and other platforms.
If you are interested in these, you can send me an email (mentioned below) and tell me what you think, and I will contact you.

## About
---
<br/>

Hi! I'm from China, a college student majoring in artificial intelligence, and I am also the manager of [`FragmentXwords`]() label, and I am currently studying for a master's degree in composition. Since 2019, I have published many music works; but since the end of 2021, I have not released any complete works, I am waiting, waiting for the beginning of my new emotion, when I will change my genre. As a college student in the Department of Computer Science, I have been favored by teachers because of my outstanding programming ability. This year (2022) I will participate in various competitions and leave the products of the whole process here.

## Research

<br/>

My research projects include ASR detection sensitive word system based on MFSC algorithm, system application of chord color, etc.
