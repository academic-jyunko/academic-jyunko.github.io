    This article explores how to use chords to enhance musical expressiveness
    from the perspectives of acoustics and the audience. Chords are crucial for
    expressing emotions and intentions in music composition, and their acoustic
    characteristics can improve emotional expression. Considering the audience's
    culture and emotions when selecting chord types and applications is
    important. Other factors such as instruments, playing techniques, rhythm,
    and speed also affect chord colors. Comprehensively considering these
    factors can achieve desired effects, making music more expressive.

    Music is an art form that conveys emotions through sound, melody, harmony, and other elements.

In music composition, chords are an important musical element and a tool for expressing emotions and intentions. This article will explore how to better use chords to enhance the expressiveness of music from both acoustic and audience perspectives.


## The Influence of Acoustic Characteristics on Chord Colors

A chord is a combination of two or more notes that, when played together, produce a certain sense of harmony. There are many types of chords, which can be classified according to the size of the intervals and the order of the notes. Among them, the most common types are major and minor chords, which consist of a major third and a minor third, or a minor third and a major third, respectively. Different chords have different acoustic characteristics, and their frequency, amplitude, and harmonics can affect the color of the sound. For example, a triad is the most basic form of chord, consisting of root, third, and fifth notes whose frequency ratios are 4:5:6, making the triad sound bright and stable. A seventh chord, on the other hand, adds a seventh note (which is usually a flattened seventh, i.e. a note lower than the root by a half step) to the triad, creating tension and a darker atmosphere.

$$
f_1=f_0\left(\frac{4}{4}\right),\ f_3=f_1\left(\frac{5}{4}\right),\ f_5=f_1\left(\frac{6}{4}\right)
$$

$$
f_1=f_0\left(\frac{4}{4}\right),\ f_3=f_1\left(\frac{5}{4}\right),\ f_5=f_1\left(\frac{6}{4}\right),\ f_7=f_1\left(\frac{7}{4}\right)
$$

To increase the expressive power of a chord in performance, additional notes called overtones can be added to enrich the sound. Overtones can be any note on the chromatic scale outside of the root, third, or fifth notes, and they can change the nature of a chord or add special effects. For example, adding a ninth note (one whole tone higher than the root) to a major triad creates a ninth chord, which has a more open and romantic sound; adding a flattened ninth note (half a tone higher than the root) to a minor triad creates a flat ninth chord, which has a more tense and mysterious sound.

f_1=f_0\left(\frac{4}{4}\right),\ f_3=f_1\left(\frac{5}{4}\right),\ f_5=f_1\left(\frac{6}{4}\right),\ f_9=f_1\left(\frac{9}{4}\right)
$$

$$
f_1=f_0\left(\frac{4}{4}\right),\ f_3=f_1\left(\frac{5}{4}\right),\ f_5=f_1\left(\frac{6}{4}\right),\ f_{\flat9}=f_1\left(\frac{17}{12}\right)
$$

> 和弦是由两个或两个以上的音符组成的组合。根据不同音符之间的音高差异，和弦可以分为大调和弦和小调和弦。不同的和弦拥有不同的频率、振幅和谐波特征。例如，三和弦中音符的频率比例为4:5:6，使其声音相对明亮；而四和弦则更多地使用降音，给人的感觉会比较暗调。在增强和弦的色彩时，还可以适当地加入一些谐波来改变声音的质感，使其更加丰富。

One of the ways to enhance the expressiveness of music is to use the acoustic characteristics of chords effectively. Chords are combinations of three or more different notes played simultaneously, and they can have different qualities and types depending on the intervals and number of notes used. For example, in classical music works, composers often use **progressive chords** to create tension and express the emotional elements depicted in the music. Progressive chords are chords that move away from the tonic or home key, such as **dominant seventh chords** or **diminished chords**. These chords have a strong tendency to resolve to a more stable chord, and they can create contrast and drama in the musical structure. By understanding how chords are constructed from scales and how they relate to each other, musicians can achieve better emotional and intentional expression in their music.

## Perception of Chord Colors from the Audience Perspective

Chords have a profound impact on people's emotions and feelings. Different cultures have different understandings of chord colors. Therefore, when creating music, chord types and application methods should be selected based on the cultural background and emotional experience of the audience.

According to the study of "Music Psychology," the audience's perception of chords is subjective and influenced by social culture and experience. For example, in traditional Chinese music, people prefer to use relatively simple chord structures to express its unique philosophical and aesthetic meanings. Therefore, in music creation, it is necessary to have an in-depth understanding of the audience's cultural background and emotional experience, and to use chords reasonably in order to achieve effective expression of emotions and intentions.

## Other Factors Affecting Chord Colors

Apart from acoustic characteristics and audience perspective, other factors such as instruments, playing techniques, rhythm, and speed can also affect chord colors. The timbre characteristics of different instruments need to be reasonably used when composing and arranging chords, while fast and smooth playing methods can usually enhance the vitality and tension of chords, making them more impactful and expressive. When designing chords, the musical environment, style, and situation should also be considered, combined with the specific context and the audience's background to select chords.

> 除了声学特征和听众角度外，乐器、演奏技巧、节奏、速度等因素也会影响和弦色彩。不同乐器的音色特点需要在创作和编配中合理运用和弦，而快速、流畅的演奏方式通常能增强和弦的活力和张力，使之更具冲击力和表现力。在设计和弦时，还需要考虑其所处的音乐环境、曲风和情景，结合具体情境和听众的背景来选择和弦。

Therefore, in the process of music creation, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the characteristics of chords, instrument timbre, playing techniques, rhythm, speed, and the audience's cultural background and emotional experience, etc., in order to better serve emotional expression and achieve the desired music effects. Only then can music be more infectious and expressive.
