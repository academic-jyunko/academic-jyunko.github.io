title: Training an acoustic model for CMUSphinx
author: CMUSphinx,简律纯
excerpt: |
  声学模型主要用于计算语音特征和每个发音模板之间的似然度。目的是为每个声学单元建立一套模型参数（通过不断地学习和改进得到最优的，也就是概率最大的一组HMM模型参数）。我们知道CMUSphinx工具包里已经自带了几个性能较高的声学模型，比如有适用于麦克风或者新闻广播语音输入的美式英语声学模型，你也可以基于大量音频数据的法语或者中文声学模型。这些模型都能够获得很好的语音识别性能，并且大部分命令控制应用都可以直接使用他们，其中包括大词汇量识别系统。除了上述模型，CMUSphinx工具包也提供了一种改进声学模型的方法，这种方法对于大部分情况来说能使系统获取更高的识别率。当我们录音的环境不同(比如近距离录音、离麦克风较远以及电话语音)、出现不同的口音(比如英式英语、印度英语)或者另外一种语言时，这个对现有声学模型的改进是非常有效的。此外，如果我们需要快捷的为系统通过使用字典文件实现声学模型音素到目标音素的映射来添加对其他一些新的语言的支持，也可以利用改进现有声学模型的这种方法。
    然而，对于一些应用程序来说当前的这些模型却不能正常工作，如手写识别或听写对另一种语言的支持。所以，在这些特殊的情况下，我们需要训练自己的模型。本文主要介绍如何在CMUSphinx语音识别工程中训练自己的声学模型。在开始训练之前，我们需要确定自己是否已经熟悉相关的概念、准备训练好的语言模型以及好相关的训练工具。

## Introduction
The CMUSphinx project comes with several high-quality acoustic models. There are US English acoustic models for microphone and broadcast speech as well as a model for speech over a telephone. You can also use French or Chinese models trained on a huge amount of acoustic data. Those models were carefully optimized to achieve the best recognition performance and work well for almost all applications. We put years of experience into making them perfect. Most command-and-control applications and even some large vocabulary applications could just use default models directly.

Besides models, CMUSphinx provides some approaches for adaptation which should suffice for most cases when more accuracy is required. Adaptation is known to work well when you are using different recording environments (close-distance or far microphone or telephone channel), or when a slightly different accent (UK English or Indian English) or even another language is present. Adaptation, for example, works well if you need to quickly add support for some new language just by mapping a phoneset of an acoustic model to a target phoneset with the dictionary.

There are, however, applications where the current models won’t work. Such examples are handwriting recognition or dictation support for another language. In these cases, you will need to train your own model and this tutorial demonstrates how to do the training for the CMUSphinx speech recognition engine. Before starting with the training make sure you are familiar with the concepts, prepared the language model. Be sure that you indeed need to train the model and that you have the resources to do that.

### When you need to train
You need to train an acoustic model if:

- You want to create an acoustic model for a new language or dialect
- OR you need a specialized model for a small vocabulary application
- AND you have plenty of data to train on:
 - 1 hour of recording for command and control for a single speaker
 - 5 hours of recordings of 200 speakers for command and control for many speakers
 - 10 hours of recordings for single speaker dictation
 - 50 hours of recordings of 200 speakers for many speakers dictation
- AND you have knowledge on the phonetic structure of the language
- AND you have time to train the model and optimize the parameters (~1 month)

### When you don’t need to train
You don’t need to train an acoustic model if:

- You need to improve accuracy – do acoustic model adaptation instead
- You do not have enough data – do acoustic model adaptation instead
- You do not have enough time
- You do not have enough experience

Please note that the amounts of data listed here are required to train a model. If you have significantly less data than listed you can not expect to train a good model. For example, you cannot train a model with 1 minute of speech data.

## Data preparation
The trainer learns the parameters for the models of the sound units using a set of sample speech signals. This is called a training database. A selection of already trained databases will also be provided to you.

The database contains information that is required to extract statistics from the speech in form of the acoustic model.

The trainer needs to be told which sound units you want it to learn the parameters of, and at least the sequence in which they occur in every speech signal in your training database. This information is provided to the trainer through a file called the transcript file. It contains the sequence of words and non-speech sounds in the exact same order as they occurred in a speech signal, followed by a tag which can be used to associate this sequence with the corresponding speech signal.

Thus, in addition to the speech signals and transcription file, the trainer needs to access two dictionaries: one in which legitimate words in the language are mapped to sequences of sound units (or sub-word units), and a another one in which non-speech sounds are mapped to corresponding non-speech or speech-like sound units. We will refer to the former as the language phonetic dictionary. The latter is called the filler dictionary. The trainer then looks into the dictionaries, to derive the sequence of sound units that are associated with each signal and transcription.

After training, it’s mandatory to run the decoder to check the training results. The Decoder takes a model, tests part of the database and reference transcriptions and estimates the quality (WER) of the model. During the testing stage we use the language model with the description of the possible order of words in the language.

To setup a training, you first need to design a training database or download an existing one. For example, you can purchase a database from LDC. You’ll have to convert it into a proper format.

A database should be a good representation of what speech you are going to recognize. For example if you are going to recognize telephone speech it is preferred to use telephone recordings. If you want to work with mobile speech, you should better find mobile recordings. Speech is significantly different across various recording channels. Broadcast news is different from a phone call. Speech decoded from mp3 is significantly different from a microphone recording. However, if you do not have enough speech recorded in the required conditions you should definitely use any other speech you have. For example you can use broadcast recordings. Sometimes it make sense to stream through the telephone codec to equalize the audio. It’s often possible to add noise to training data too.

The database should have recording of enough speakers, a variety of recording conditions, enough acoustic variations and all possible linguistic sentences. As mentioned before, The size of the database depends on the complexity of the task you want to handle.

A database should have the two parts mentioned above: a training part and a test part. Usually the test part is about 1/10th of the total data size, but we don’t recommend you to have more than 4 hours of recordings as test data.

Good approaches to obtain a database for a new language are:

- Manually segmenting audio recordings with existing transcription (podcasts, news, etc.)
- Recording your friends and family and colleagues
- Setting up an automated collection on Voxforge

You have to design database prompts and post-process the results to ensure that the audio actually corresponds to the prompts. The file structure for the database is the following:
```
├─ etc
│  ├─ your_db.dic                 (Phonetic dictionary)
│  ├─ your_db.phone               (Phoneset file)
│  ├─ your_db.lm.DMP              (Language model)
│  ├─ your_db.filler              (List of fillers)
│  ├─ your_db_train.fileids       (List of files for training)
│  ├─ your_db_train.transcription (Transcription for training)
│  ├─ your_db_test.fileids        (List of files for testing)
│  └─ your_db_test.transcription  (Transcription for testing)
└─ wav
   ├─ speaker_1
   │   └─ file_1.wav              (Recording of speech utterance)
   └─ speaker_2
      └─ file_2.wav
```
Let’s go through the files and describe their format and the way to prepare them:

***.fileids:** `The your_db_train.fileids` and `your_db_test.fileids` files are text files which list the names of the recordings (utterance ids) one by one, for example:
```
speaker_1/file_1
speaker_2/file_2
```
A _*.fileids_ file contains the path in a file-system relative to the wav directory. Note that a *.fileids file should not include audio file extensions in its content, but rather just the names.

**.transcription:** The your_db_train.transcription and your_db_test.transcription files are text files listing the transcription for each audio file:
```
<s> hello world </s> (file_1)
<s> foo bar </s> (file_2)
```
It’s important that each line starts with <s> and ends with </s> followed by an id in parentheses. Also note that the parentheses contains only the file, without the speaker_n directory. It’s critical to have an exact match between the *.fileids file and the *.transcription file. The number of lines in both should be identical. The last part of the file id (speaker1/file_1) and the utterance id file_1 must be the same on each line.

Below is an example of an incorrect _*.fileids_ file for the above transcription file. If you follow it, you will get an error as discussed here:
```
speaker_2/file_2
speaker_1/file_1
// Bad! Do not create *.fileids files like this!
```
**Speech recordings (*.wav files):** Your audio recordings should contain training audio which should match the audio you want to recognize in the end. In case of a mismatch you could experience a sometimes even significant drop of the accuracy. This means if you want to recognize continuous speech, your training database should record continuous speech. For continuous speech the optimal length for audio recordings is between 5 seconds and 30 seconds. Very long recordings make training much harder. If you are going to recognize short isolated commands, your training database should also contain files with short isolated commands. It is better to design the database to recognize continuous speech from the beginning though and not spend your time on commands. In the end you speak continuously anyway. The Amount of silence in the beginning and in the end of the utterance should not exceed 200 ms.

Recording files must be in MS WAV format with a specific sample rate – 16 kHz, 16 bit, mono for desktop application, 8kHz, 16bit, mono for telephone applications. It’s critical that the audio files have a specific format. Sphinxtrain does support some variety of sample rates but by default it is configured to train from 16khz 16bit mono files in MS WAV format.

**So, please make sure that your recordings have a samplig rate of 16 kHz `(or 8 kHz if you train a telephone model)` in mono with a single channel!**

If you train from an 8 kHz model you need to make sure you configured the feature extraction properly. Please note that you cannot upsample your audio, that means you can not train 16 kHz model with 8 kHz data.

A mismatch of the audio format is the most common training problem – make sure you eliminated this source of problems.

**Phonetic Dictionary (your_db.dict):** should have one line per word with the word following the phonetic transcription:
```
HELLO HH AH L OW
WORLD W AO R L D
```
If you need to find a phonetic dictionary, have a look on Wikipedia or read a book on phonetics. If you are using an existing phonetic dictionary do not use case-sensitive variants like “e” and “E”. Instead, all your phones must be different even in the case-insensitive variation. Sphinxtrain doesn’t support some special characters like “*” or “/” and supports most of others like “+”, “-“ or “:”. However, to be safe we recommend you to use alphanumeric-only phone-set.

Replace special characters in the phone-set, like colons, dashes or tildes, with something alphanumeric. For example, replace “a~” with “aa” to make it alphanumeric only. Nowadays, even cell phones have gigabytes of memory on board. There is no sense in trying to save space with cryptic special characters.

There is one very important thing here. For a large vocabulary database, the phonetic representation is more or less known; it’s simple phones described in any book. If you don’t have a phonetic book, you can just use the word’s spelling and it will also give you very good results:
```
ONE O N E
TWO T W O
```
For a small vocabulary CMUSphinx is different from other toolkits. It’s often recommended to train word-based models for a small vocabulary databases like digits. Yet, this only makes sense if your HMMs could have variable length.

CMUSphinx does not support word models. Instead, you need to use a word-dependent phone dictionary:
```
ONE W_ONE AH_ONE N_ONE
TWO T_TWO UH_TWO
NINE N_NINE AY_NINE N_END_NINE
```
This is actually equivalent to word-based models and some times even gives better accuracy. Do not use word-based models with CMUSphinx!

**Phoneset file (your_db.phone):** should have one phone per line. The number of phones should match the phones used in the dictionary plus the special SIL phone for silence:
```
AH
AX
DH
IX
```
**Language model file (your_db.lm.DMP):** should be in ARPA format or in DMP format. Find our more about language models in the Building a language model chapter.

**Filler dictionary (your_db.filler):** contains filler phones (not-covered by language model non-linguistic sounds like breath, “hmm” or laugh). It can contain just silences:
```
<s> SIL
</s> SIL
<sil> SIL
```
It can also contain filler phones if they are present in the database transcriptions:
```
+um+ ++um++
+noise+ ++noise++
```
The sample database for training is available on GitHub at https://github.com/cmusphinx/an4. You can use this database in the following sections. If you want to play with a large example, download the TED-LIUM English acoustic database. It contains about 200 hours of audio recordings at present.

## Compilation of the required packages
The following packages are required for training. On Linux you can install them with the usual package manager (apt or yum or dnf or whatever):
```
git
cmake (version 3.14 or higher)
perl
python3
python3-numpy (only if using LDA or MLLR)
python3-scipy (only if using MLLT)
```
We recommend that you train on Linux: this way you’ll be able to use all the features of sphinxtrain. You can also use a Windows system for training, in that case we recommend to use Windows System for Linux, in which case the process is exactly the same.

If you insist on building “natively” on Windows, you will need to ensure that Perl and Python are available in your command-line search path. The easiest way by far to do this is to use Anaconda - after configuring your environment, you can proceed to install Perl with:
```
conda install -c anaconda perl
```
You will additionaly need to download and build:

- pocketsphinx
For further download instructions, see the download page.

It is highly recommended to use git to download the necessary code and data, and to put everything in a single folder:
```
mkdir tutorial
cd tutorial
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cmusphinx/an4.git
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cmusphinx/sphinxtrain.git
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx.git
```
By the time you finish this, you will have a tutorial directory with the following contents:
```
└─ tutorial
   ├─ an4
   ├─ sphinxtrain
   └─ pocketsphinx
```
You do not need to install things system-wide. Unless you know what you’re doing, please don’t do this. On the other hand you will need to copy the pocketsphinx_batch program into the build folder for sphinxtrain so it can find it. The whole process looks like:
```
cmake -S sphinxtrain -B sphinxtrain/build
cmake --build sphinxtrain/build
cmake -S pocketsphinx -B pocketsphinx/build
cmake --build pocketsphinx/build
cp pocketsphinx/build/pocketsphinx_batch sphinxtrain/build
```
## Setting up the training scripts
To start the training, change to the database folder and run the following commands:
```
python ../sphinxtrain/scripts/sphinxtrain -t an4 setup
```
Do not forget to replace an4 with your task name.

This will copy all the required configuration files into the etc/ subfolder of your database folder and will prepare the database for training. The directory structure after the setup will look like this:
```
├─ etc
└─ wav
```
In the process of the training other data folders will be created, so that your database directory should look like this:
```
├─ etc
├─ feat
├─ logdir
├─ model_parameters
├─ model_architecture
├─ result
└─ wav
```
After this basic setup, we need to edit the configuration files in the etc/ folder. There are many variables but to get started we need to change only a few. First of all, find the file etc/sphinx_train.cfg.

### Setting up the format of database audio
In `etc/sphinx_train.cfg` you should see the following configurations:
```
$CFG_WAVFILES_DIR = "$CFG_BASE_DIR/wav";
$CFG_WAVFILE_EXTENSION = 'wav';
$CFG_WAVFILE_TYPE = 'mswav'; # one of nist, mswav, raw
```
### Configuring file paths
Search for the following lines in your etc/sphinx_train.cfg file:
```
# Variables used in main training of models
$CFG_DICTIONARY     = "$CFG_LIST_DIR/$CFG_DB_NAME.dic";
$CFG_RAWPHONEFILE   = "$CFG_LIST_DIR/$CFG_DB_NAME.phone";
$CFG_FILLERDICT     = "$CFG_LIST_DIR/$CFG_DB_NAME.filler";
$CFG_LISTOFFILES    = "$CFG_LIST_DIR/${CFG_DB_NAME}_train.fileids";
$CFG_TRANSCRIPTFILE = "$CFG_LIST_DIR/${CFG_DB_NAME}_train.transcription"
```
These values would be already set if you set up the file structure like described earlier, but make sure that your files are really named this way.

The $CFG_LIST_DIR variable is the /etc directory in your project. The $CFG_DB_NAME variable is the name of your project itself.

Configuring model type and model parameters
To select the acoustic model type see the Acoustic Model Types article.

$CFG_HMM_TYPE = '.cont.'; # Sphinx4, Pocketsphinx
#$CFG_HMM_TYPE  = '.semi.'; # PocketSphinx only
#$CFG_HMM_TYPE  = '.ptm.'; # Sphinx4, Pocketsphinx, faster model
Just uncomment what you need. For resource-efficient applications use semi-continuous models, for best accuracy use continuous models. By default we use PTM models which provide a nice balance between accuracy and speed.
```
$CFG_FINAL_NUM_DENSITIES = 8;
```
If you are training continuous models for a large vocabulary and have more than 100 hours of data, put 32 here. It can be any power of 2: 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.

If you are training semi-continuous or PTM model, use 256 gaussians.
```
# Number of tied states (senones) to create in decision-tree clustering
$CFG_N_TIED_STATES = 1000;
```
This value is the number of senones to train in a model. The more senones a model has, the more precisely it discriminates the sounds. On the other hand, if you have too many senones, the model will not be generic enough to recognize yet unseen speech. That means that the WER will be higher on unseen data. That’s why it is important to not overtrain the models. In case there are too many unseen senones, the warnings will be generated in the norm log on stage 50 below:
```
ERROR: "gauden.c", line 1700: Variance (mgau= 948, feat= 0, density=3,
component=38) is less then 0. Most probably the number of senones is too
high for such a small training database. Use smaller $CFG_N_TIED_STATES.
```
The approximate number of senones and the number of densities for a continuous model is provided in the table below:

| **Vocabulary** | **Audio in database / hours** | **Senones** | **Densities** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | -----|
| 20 | 5 | 200 | 8 | Tidigits Digits Recognition |
| 100 | 20 | 2000 | 8 | RM1 Command and Control |
| 5000 | 30 | 4000 | 16 | WSJ1 5k Small Dictation |
| 20000 | 80 | 4000 | 32 | WSJ1 20k Big Dictation |
| 60000 | 200 | 6000 | 16 | HUB4 Broadcast News |
| 60000 | 2000 | 12000 | 64 | Fisher Rich Telephone Transcription |

For semi-continuous and PTM models use a fixed number of 256 densities.

Of course you also need to understand that only senones that are present in transcription can be trained. It means that if your transcription isn’t generic enough, e.g. if it’s the same single word spoken by 10.000 speakers 10.000 times you still have just a few senones no matter how many hours of speech you recorded. In that case you just need a few senones in the model, not thousands of them.

Though it might seem that diversity could improve the model that’s not the case. Diverse speech requires some artificial speech prompts and that decreases the speech naturalness. Artificial models don’t help in real life decoding. In order to build the best database you need to try to reproduce the real environment as much as possible. It’s even better to collect more speech to try to optimize the database size.

It’s important to remember, that optimal numbers depend on your database. To train a model properly, you need to experiment with different values and try to select the ones which result in the best WER for a development set. You can experiment with the number of senones and the number of Gaussian mixtures at least. Sometimes it’s also worth to experiment with the phoneset or the number of estimation iterations.

### Configuring sound feature parameters
The default for sound files used in Sphinx is a rate of 16 thousand samples per second (16 KHz). If this is the case, the etc/feat.params file will be automatically generated with the recommended values.

If you are using sound files with a sampling rate of 8 kHz (telephone audio), you need to change some values in etc/sphinx_train.cfg. The lower sampling rate also means a change in the sound frequency ranges and the number of filters that are used to recognize speech. Recommended values are:
```
# Feature extraction parameters
$CFG_WAVFILE_SRATE = 8000.0;
$CFG_NUM_FILT = 31; # For wideband speech it's 40, for telephone 8khz reasonable value is 31
$CFG_LO_FILT = 200; # For telephone 8kHz speech value is 200
$CFG_HI_FILT = 3500; # For telephone 8kHz speech value is 3500
```
### Configuring parallel jobs to speedup the training

If you are on a multicore machine or in a PBS cluster you can run the training in parallel. The following options should do the trick:
```
# Queue::POSIX for multiple CPUs on a local machine
# Queue::PBS to use a PBS/TORQUE queue
$CFG_QUEUE_TYPE = "Queue";
```
### Change the type to “Queue::POSIX” to run on multicore. Then change the number of parallel processes to run:
```
# How many parts to run Forward-Backward estimation in
$CFG_NPART = 1;
$DEC_CFG_NPART = 1; #  Define how many pieces to split decode in
```
If you are running on an 8-core machine start around 10 parts to fully load the CPU during training.

### Configuring decoding parameters
Open etc/sphinx_train.cfg and make sure the following configurations are set:
```
$DEC_CFG_DICTIONARY     = "$CFG_BASE_DIR/etc/$CFG_DB_NAME.dic";
$DEC_CFG_FILLERDICT     = "$CFG_BASE_DIR/etc/$CFG_DB_NAME.filler";
$DEC_CFG_LISTOFFILES    = "$CFG_BASE_DIR/etc/${CFG_DB_NAME}_test.fileids";
$DEC_CFG_TRANSCRIPTFILE = "$CFG_BASE_DIR/etc/${CFG_DB_NAME}_test.transcription";
$DEC_CFG_RESULT_DIR     = "$CFG_BASE_DIR/result";

# These variables are used by the decoder and have to be defined by the user.
# They may affect the decoder output.

$DEC_CFG_LANGUAGEMODEL  = "$CFG_BASE_DIR/etc/${CFG_DB_NAME}.lm.DMP";
```
If you are training with an4 please make sure that you changed ${CFG_DB_NAME}.lm.DMP to an4.ug.lm.DMP since the name of the language model is different in an4 database:
```
$DEC_CFG_LANGUAGEMODEL  = "$CFG_BASE_DIR/etc/an4.ug.lm.DMP";
```
If everything is OK, you can proceed to training.

## Training
First of all, go to the database directory:
```
cd an4
```
To train, just run the following commands:
```
python ../sphinxtrain/scripts/sphinxtrain run
```
and it will go through all the required stages. It will take a few minutes to train. On large databases, training could take up to a month.

The most important stage is the first one which checks that everything is configured correctly and your input data is consistent.

Do not ignore the errors reported on the first 00.verify_all step!

The typical output during decoding will look like:
```
Baum Welch starting for 2 Gaussian(s), iteration: 3 (1 of 1)
0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%
Normalization for iteration: 3
Current Overall Likelihood Per Frame = 30.6558644286942
Convergence Ratio = 0.633864444461992
Baum Welch starting for 2 Gaussian(s), iteration: 4 (1 of 1)
0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%
Normalization for iteration: 4
```
These scripts process all required steps to train the model. After they finished, the training is complete.

## Training internals
This section describes in detail what happens during the training.

In the scripts directory (./scripts), there are several directories numbered sequentially from 00 through 99. Each directory either has a directory named slave*.pl or it has a single file with the extension .pl. The script sequentially goes through the directories and executes either the slave*.pl or the single .pl file, as below.
```
perl scripts/000.comp_feat/slave_feat.pl
perl scripts/00.verify/verify_all.pl
perl scripts/10.vector_quantize/slave.VQ.pl
perl scripts/20.ci_hmm/slave_convg.pl
perl scripts/30.cd_hmm_untied/slave_convg.pl
perl scripts/40.buildtrees/slave.treebuilder.pl
perl scripts/45.prunetree/slave-state-tying.pl
perl scripts/50.cd_hmm_tied/slave_convg.pl
perl scripts/90.deleted_interpolation/deleted_interpolation.pl
```
These scripts launch jobs on your machine, and the jobs will take a few minutes each to run through.

Before you run any script, note the directory contents of your current directory. After you run each slave.pl look at the the contents again. Several new directories will have been created. These directories contain files which are being generated in the course of your training. At this point you don’t need to know about the contents of these directories, though some of the directory names may be self-explanatory and you may explore them if you are curious.

One of the files that appears in your current directory is an .html file, named an4.html, depending on which database you are using. This file will contain a status report of the already executed jobs. Verify that the job you launched completed successfully. Only then launch the next slave.pl in the specified order. Repeat this process until you have run the slave.pl in all directories.

Note that in the process of going through the scripts from 00 to 90, you will have generated several sets of acoustic models, each of which could be used for recognition. Notice also that some of the steps are required only for the creation of semi-continuous models. If you execute these steps while creating continuous models, the scripts will benignly do nothing.

In the stage 000.comp_feat the feature files are extracted. The system does not directly work with acoustic signals. The signals are first transformed into a sequence of feature vectors, which are used in place of the actual acoustic signals.

This script slave_feat.pl will compute a sequence of 13-dimensional vectors (feature vectors) for each training utterance consisting of the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). Note that the list of wave files contains a list with the full paths to the audio files. Since the data is all located in the same directory as your working directory, the paths are relative, not absolute. If the location of data is different, you may have to change this, as well as the an4_test.fileids file. The MFCCs will be placed automatically in a directory called feat. Note that the type of features vectors you compute from the speech signals for training and recognition, outside of this tutorial, is not restricted to MFCCs. You could use any reasonable parameterization technique instead, and compute features other than MFCCs. CMUSphinx can use features of any type or dimensionality. The format of the features is described on the MFC Format page.

Once the jobs launched from 20.ci_hmm have run to completion, you will have trained the Context-Independent (CI) models for the sub-word units in your dictionary.

When the jobs launched from the 30.cd_hmm_untied directory run to completion, you will have trained the models for Context-Dependent sub-word units (triphones) with untied states. These are called CD-untied models and are necessary for building decision trees in order to tie states.

The jobs in 40.buildtrees will build decision trees for each state of each sub-word unit.

The jobs in 45.prunetree will prune the decision trees and tie the states.

Following this, the jobs in 50.cd-hmm_tied will train the final models for the triphones in your training corpus. These are called CD-tied models. The CD-tied models are trained in many stages. We begin with 1 Gaussian per state HMMs, followed by training 2 Gaussian per state HMMs and so on till the desired number of Gaussians per State have been trained. The jobs in 50.cd-hmm_tied will automatically train all these intermediate CD-tied models.

At the end of any stage you may use the models for recognition. Remember that you may decode even while the training is in progress, provided you are certain that you have crossed the stage which generates the models you want to decode with.

### Transformation matrix training (advanced)
Some additional scripts will be launched if you choose to run them. These additional training steps can be costly in computation, but improve the recognition rate.

Transform matrices might help the training and recognition process in some circumstances.

The following steps will run if you specify
```
$CFG_LDA_MLLT = 'yes';
```
in the file sphinx_train.cfg. If you specify 'no' (which is the default), the steps will do nothing. The Step 01.lda_train will estimate a LDA matrix and the step 02.mllt_train will estimate a MLLT matrix.

The Perl scripts, in turn, set up and run Python modules. The end product for these steps is a feature_transform file, in your model_parameters directory. For details see the page for Training with LDA and MLLT.

## MMIE training (advanced)
Finally, one more step will run if you specify MMIE training by setting:
```
$CFG_MMIE =  "yes";
```
The default value is "no". This will run steps 60.lattice_generation, 61.lattice_pruning, 62.lattice_conversion and 65.mmie_train.

This requires you to have Sphinx-III installed somewhere, and is not currently supported.

For details see the page about MMIE Training in SphinxTrain.

## Testing
It’s critical to test the quality of the trained database in order to select the best parameters, understand how your application performs and optimize the performance. To do that, a test decoding step is needed. The decoding is now a last stage of the training process.

You can restart decoding with the following command:
```
sphinxtrain -s decode run
```
This command will start a decoding process using the acoustic model you trained and the language model you configured in the etc/sphinx_train.cfg file.
```
MODULE: DECODE Decoding using models previously trained
Decoding 130 segments starting at 0 (part 1 of 1)
0%
```
When the recognition job is complete, the script computes the recognition Word Error Rate (WER) and the Sentence Error Rate (SER). The lower those rates the better is your recognition. For a typical 10-hours task the WER should be around 10%. For a large task, it could be like 30%.

On an4 data you should get something like:
```
SENTENCE ERROR: 70.8% (92/130)   WORD ERROR RATE: 30.3% (233/773)
```
You can find exact details of the decoding, like the alignment with a reference transcription, speed and the result for each file, in the result folder which will be created after decoding. Let’s have a look into the file an4.align:
```
p   I   T      t   s   b   u   r   g   H      (MMXG-CEN5-MMXG-B)

TOTAL Percent correct = 75.94% Error = 30.27% Accuracy = 69.73%
TOTAL Insertions: 48 Deletions: 15 Substitutions: 171
```
For a description of the WER see our Basic concepts of speech chapter.

## Using the model

After training, the acoustic model is located in

```
model_parameters/`<your_db_name>`.cd_cont_`<number_of senones>`
```

or in

```
model_parameters/`<your_db_name>`.cd_semi_`<number_of senones>`
```

You need only that folder. The model should have the following files:

```
mdef
feat.params
mixture_weights
means
noisedict
transition_matrices
variances
```

depending on the type of the model you trained. To use the model in PocketSphinx, simply point to it with the -hmm option:

```
pocketsphinx_continuous -hmm `<your_new_model_folder>` -lm `<your_lm>` -dict `<your_dict>`.
```

To use the trained model in Sphinx4, you need to specify the path in the Configuration object:

```
configuration.setAcousticModelPath("file:model_parameters/db.cd_cont_200");
```

If the model is in the resources you can reference it with resource:URL:

```
configuration.setAcousticModelPath("resource:/com/example/db.cd_cont_200");
```

See the Sphinx4 tutorial for details.

## Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting is not rocket science. For all issues you may blame yourself. You are most likely the reason of failure. Carefully read the messages in the logdir folder that contains a detailed log for each performed action. In addition, messages are copied to the your_project_name.html file, which you can open and read in a browser.

There are many well-working, proven methods to solve issues. For example, try to reduce the training set to see in which half the problem appears.

Here are some common problems:

- **WARNING: this phone (something) appears in the dictionary (dictionary file name), but not in the phone list (phone file name).**

  Your dictionary either contains a mistake, or you have left out a phone symbol in the phone file. You may have to delete any comment lines from your dictionary file.

- **WARNING: This word (word) has duplicate entries in (dictionary file name). Check for duplicates.**

  You may have to sort your dictionary file lines to find them. Perhaps a word is defined in both upper and lower case forms.

- **WARNING: This word: word was in the transcript file, but is not in the dictionary (transcript line) Do cases match?**

  Make sure that all the words in the transcript are in the dictionary, and that they have matching cases when they appear. Also, words in the transcript may be misspelled, run together or be a number or symbol that is not in the dictionary. If the dictionary file is not perfectly sorted, some entries might be skipped while looking for words. If you hand-edited the dictionary file, be sure that each entry is in the proper format.

  You may have specified phones in the phone list that are not represented in the words in the transcript. The trainer expects to find examples of each phone at least once.

- **WARNING: CTL file, audio file name.mfc, does not exist, or is empty.**

  The .mfc files are the feature files converted from the input audio files in stage 000.comp_feats. Did you skip this step? Did you add new audio files without converting them? The training process expects a feature file to be there, but it isn’t.

- **Very low recognition accuracy**

  This might happen if there is a mismatch in the audio files and the parameters of training, or between the training and the testing.

- **ERROR: “backward.c”, line 430: Failed to align audio to transcript: final state of the search is not reached.**

  Sometimes audio in your database doesn’t match the transcription properly. For example the transcription file has the line “Hello world” but in audio actually “Hello hello world” is pronounced. The training process usually detects that and emits this message in the logs. If there are too many of such errors it most likely means you misconfigured something, e.g. you had a mismatch between audio and the text caused by transcription reordering. If there are few errors, you can ignore them. You might want to edit the transcription file to put the exact word which was pronounced. In the case above you need to edit the transcription file and put “Hello hello world” on the corresponding line. You might want to filter such prompts because they affect the quality of the acoustic model. In that case you need to enable the forced alignment stage during training. To do that edit the following line in sphinx_train.cfg:
  
  ```
  $CFG_FORCEDALIGN = 'yes';
  ```
  
  and run the training again. It will execute stages 10 and 11 and will filter your database.

- **Can’t open */*-1-1.match word_align.pl failed with error code 65280**

  This error occurs because the decoder did not run properly after the training. First check if the correct executable is present in your PATH. The executable shouldbe pocketsphinx_batch if the decoding script being used is psdecode.pl as set by the $DEC_CFG_SCRIPT variable in sphinx_train.cfg. On Linux run:
  
  ```
  which pocketsphinx_batch
  ```
  
  and see if it is located as expected. If it is not, you need to set the PATH variable properly. Similarly on Windows, run:
  
  ```
  where pocketsphinx_batch
  ```
  
  If the path to the decoding executable is set properly, read the log files in logdir/decode/ to find out other reasons for the error.
